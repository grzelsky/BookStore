Bookstore app.

#

The application based on the react library was used to manage its state with the Context API. The application presents a bookstore where products are divided into three categories: books, e-books, audiobooks. Each of the products has assigned types. In the application, it is possible to add the product that interests us to the basket. The basket can be cleaned or products can be removed individually.
There is an admin panel under the icon of the man, you can log in using the login: admin, password: admin. The admin function allows you to add product to the database via the form. Admin can also remove products from the database. If you want to fully check the application. Please clone the repository and run JSON server (npm run start: db) locally. When designing this application, I wanted to show the basic skills in the react library, react router, using the Context API and downloading and sending data from an external source (adding and subtracting products in the admin function).
At grzelsky.github.io/bookstore/ you can check how application looks. the application at this address uses the database placed on "my JSON Server" and due to this there are some limitations. The application here is not fully functional, but I wanted to show it how it looks. It has two of the three products (books and e-books). There are also restrictions on adding and subtracting products to the database in the admin tab. As stated before, I wanted to show how this application looks. Therefore, if you feel like fully checking the application. Please clone the repository and run JSON server (npm run start: db) locally and run the application (npm start)
